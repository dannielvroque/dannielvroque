Hello, Iâ€™m Danniel Roque!
With over 5 years of experience as a C++ developer, I have built my core skill set around C++. However, I have also gained experience with a wide range of technologies and tools, including Docker, AWS, GCP, Azure, CI/CD, DevOps, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Linux, Windows, Red Hat Enterprise, Terraform, Cloud, and Kubernetes (k8s).

I am committed to enhancing my knowledge in Cloud Computing, with a particular interest in AWS and Azure. As part of my involvement in DevOps, I have been developing pipelines and utilizing Terraform to optimize cloud deployments, always striving for efficient and high-quality solutions.

I am a collaborative professional, open to communication and constructive feedback, always ready to work in a team. My professional journey is driven by a continuous pursuit of growth and learning opportunities. Additionally, I have a B1/B2 proficiency level in English and am dedicated to improving my skills in a second language.

ðŸ”­ Currently working with back-end development, with C++ as my main skill, focusing on both On-Premises and AWS Cloud environments.

ðŸŒ± Studying AWS and GCP Clouds, DevOps culture, and SRE.
